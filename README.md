To make Homebridge aware of the new plugin, you will have to add it to your configuration usually found in `.homebridge/config.json`. Somewhere inside that file you should see a key named `accessories`. This is where you can add your tv as shown here:

```


"accessories": [
{
"accessory": "SonyTV",
"name": "Fernseher",
"mac": "3C-07-71-DB-E2-A9",
"ip": "192.168.2.3",

"maxchannels": 500,
"soundoutput":"speaker",
"onscript":"/home/pi/scripts/dolbyon.sh", // can be empty
"offscript":"/home/pi/scripts/dolbyoff.sh",  // can bee empty
"savefilenameprefix":"/home/pi/sonycookie"  // <- (default when its empty) is a file prefix, not path prefix. Make sure after enter pin in console in sudo mode that file is readable (chmod 777 ..)
